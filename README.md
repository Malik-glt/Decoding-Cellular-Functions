# Decoding Cellular Functions
The purpose of this research work is to combine pre-trained language models with deep-learning neural networks to identify functional classes of amino acids and peptides from other secondary active transporters and also to predict the same function class for a solute carrier protein (SLC). The purpose of this computational framework is to enhance our understanding of the functional roles of secondary active transporters and solute carrier proteins (SLCs), thus facilitating insights into their interaction with the processes in the cell and the diseases they cause.Â In order to increase our understanding of the complex world of cellular proteins and their relevance to human diseases, these techniques can help researchers improve their understanding of the complex world of cellular proteins.
